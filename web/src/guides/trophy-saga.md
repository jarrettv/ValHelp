## Overview

Saga mode is part of the Trophy Hunt Mod made by Oathorse. Trophies are 100% drop rate for the same point values as the vanilla version. See the [trophy calc](/trophy/calc) for the most up to date scoring. It’s also an “accelerated” way to play the game. For example, metal scraps smelt into bars instantly upon entering your inventory, sailing speed is increased, portal all items, biome specific mobs drop boss items (more on this later) and production build pieces like kilns, beehives and fermenters are almost instant, crops grow in seconds, bosses after Eikthyr drop 10 Ymir Flesh.

Saga can be overwhelming to get started with, especially considering the 4 hour time limit for events. I made this guide on Saga for beginners to get started and help with the learning curve. I am going to strip back much of the fluff and focus on what I consider to be “core numbers and requirements” to be successful in reaching later biomes and thus, higher scores. I will be excluding basic materials like stone, wood, leather, deer hide, bones, etc. and focusing on the numbers for progression. 

## Meadows

- Kill Eikthyr for antler pickaxe (hang trophy at spawn, activate power - optional but recommended)
- Find at least one queen bee for early stamina food. Beehives fill within seconds and production is doubled. Honey is also important for mead later.
- 25 flint. It’s important to carry 25 flint with you to your initial base setup for the chopping block and tanning rack.

Greylings have upgraded drops, most notably are the Megingjord Belt and fine wood. Carry as much fine wood with you as you can from greylings, minimum is 20 (more on that later).

Use whichever weapon you are most comfortable with. If using flint spear, I recommend getting level 2 ASAP and then stop upgrading it as better weapons will soon become unlocked.

Deer trophies drop 100% of the time even after picking up the first one. You need 2 to summon the boss. I recommend getting an additional 5 for Stagbreaker.

## Black forest

- Copper: 81, Tin: 41
- Kill at least one Greydwarf Brute as they drop the Crypt Key the Elder normally drops.
- At least 4 Surtling Cores for a portal set. (more is better for bonfire, oven, more portals, etc.)

Bring 20 fine wood with you from the Greylings. If you only found 20 fine wood, bring some leather scraps and 4 uncooked meat (This will be turned into coal). Next get the Surtling Cores from a Burial Chamber. Try to find Copper close-ish to Tin. 81 Copper and 41 Tin gets you a Forge, Mead Kettle, Cauldron, Fermenter, Adze, Anvils, Bronze Axe, Cultivator, Nails for Carve, extra copper for Cooling Bucket and Pots and Pans.

Note: If you don’t have a Megingjord Belt from Greylings yet, Trolls have a 66% chance to drop it.

While Mining Copper/Tin, make a campfire with 2 cooking racks and burn the 4 uncooked meat you brought into coal on site. Build a quick shelter for a forge and make a Bronze axe, put a portal down, run back to your starter base with 2 cores and 10 eyes, chop fine wood for second portal and put at your base. (Note: You can skip making an axe on site if you have 40 fine wood from Greylings) Portal all of your Copper and Tin back and make everything you need. At this point you should have level 4 workbench, level 2 Forge, Cauldron, Mead Kettle, Bronze Axe, Cultivator, Karve.

I try to start a Saga Run like this. Obviously I left out numbers for miscellaneous materials. You can use whatever weapons/armor you want, I recommend using Bear Fists and a level 2 Bronze Spear. If going the Bronze Spear route, change the numbers to Copper: 101, Tin: 51

As a rule of wrist (haha XD), a good benchmark for having all of this done and sailing south is 1:05:00. This allows you to catch the second south wind comfortably (this time is without sleeping).

## Swamp

This is where the routes can start to change. You can go Silver weapons, Black Metal weapons, Mistwalker, etc. I focus on the Silver Route in this guide because I feel it is safer and more consistent.

- 7 stacks of Iron (use 10 to make 100 Iron Nails)
- 25 Ooze minimum
- 10 roots
- Turnip seeds (for level 2 Cauldron and better food)
- Approx 100 Ancient Bark (see note below)
- Kill at least one Oozer as it drops a Wishbone for locating Silver
- 5 chains (optional but see note below)

### Ancient Bark
(40 for Longship, 5 for Bonfire, 2 for Butcher’s Block, 10 for Root Harness, the rest for Fang spear or Frostner if desired. The reason I Say “Approx” is because individual runs deviate sometimes depending on finding a boss or what the world gives in general)

### Chains
This is used for cooking Serpent Meat if you happen to find one, then making Black Metal Shield. If you don’t find enough Chain, you can Make Silver Shield or Iron Shield instead.

At this point you should have a Longship, Root Harness, Iron Pickaxe and whatever weapons You would like to make. I personally make a level one iron mace and a level one huntsman bow.

## Mountain

- Kill 2 drakes as they drop Moder Tears, 2 are needed for Artisan Bench.
- 137 Silver (100 for level 3 Silver Sword, 2 for Butcher Block, 5 for level 3 Fang Spear, 30 for Frostner)
- Onion seeds (for Wolf Skewers and Salads)
- 10 Wolf Fangs (for level 3 Fang Spear)

At this point, you should have an Artisan Bench, Level 3 Silver Sword, level 3 Cauldron.

## Plains

- 160 Flax (for level 4 Padded Helmet, level 4 Padded Pants, enough for Black Metal Axe if needed)
- 10 barley (for Fire Resistance Mead)
- 19 Cloudberries (for Fire Resistance Mead and Salad)
- 13 Black Metal (for Pots and Pans and Black Metal Shield)
- Kill a Lox for Lox Meat

Notes about Plains: Once you find flax, you can mass produce it in the plains as crops grow in 10 seconds. Once you have 160 flax, use 20 of the Iron Nails and 40 of the Fine Wood from your Longship and some leather scraps to make 2 spinning wheels and process all of the Flax. Then make level 4 Padded Helmet and level 4 Padded Pants. Ooze bombs will one-shot a Fuling Shaman if you get a sneak hit which is very helpful.

At this point in the run you should have sufficient gear and weapons for Mistlands and nabbing a few trophies in the Ashlands.

## Mistlands

- 3 to 4 Seeker Meat
- 3 to 4 Hare Meat
- 3 to 9 Yotun Puffs (for Salad)
- 8 Black Marble (for Mortar and Pestle)

Requirements for Drakkar (optional, but suggested for getting to Ashlands):
- Kill one Seeker Soldier for a Majestic Carapace.
- Kill enough Dvergrs to get 25 Yddrasil Wood.
- Approx one stack of Black Marble (for Mortar and Pestle, Artisan Press, 30 Ceramic Plates)

Make a Food Preparation Table and Oven from materials at base to make Meat Platters. Make a Mortar and Pestle to make Salad. Break Fermenter for 5 Bronze and use with Majestic Carapace and Black Marble for Artisan Press. Craft 30 Ceramic Plates and break Artisan Press to re-make Fermenter if needed.

At this point in the game, you will have Pre-Ashlands BIS health food and stamina food. You can use Serpent Stew, Wolf Skewers, or whatever else you like for the third food slot. You also have arguably one of the most important tools for getting to the Ashlands, the Drakkar. The Drakkar is not required to get to the Ashlands in Saga, but it makes it much more consistent vs Longship to actually reach shore.

Once in the Ashlands, there won’t be much time left, so kill what you can for trophies.

## Ashlands

TBD

## Final Thoughts

Saga is a complex mode to play the game with. It requires re-learning somethings as well as a bit of practice to get a feel for what gear and pace is comfortable for you. Yes there are other routes and other tech you can do, however my goal with this guide was to give people a solid starting point and some core numbers with metal to work with as well as what I personally feel is a relatively safe and consistent “route” to do a 4 hour run with.

The important thing to practice is what to do when situations arise that do not fit your plan. For example, if you do not find enough chains for a black metal shield, you will have to adjust your metal numbers accordingly for an Iron shield or Silver Shield, or be crazy like me and go no shield at all.

I hope this guide has been helpful to you!

(I can do a much more in depth guide if there’s interest in me doing so)
