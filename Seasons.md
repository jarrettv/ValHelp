The series module is a new way to automatically generate events on a schedule. The database is already setup to store seasons with the information needed to pull that off.

We need backend endpoints to support new front-end screens.

Home page should have a new "Series" button that you can "View or create seasons"

New "Series" index screen that lists all the active seasons and lets you go back and look at old seasons.

We should easily be able to see latest and upcoming events on the series index screen.

We need an Series edit screen for creating and updating series. Use the EventEdit screen for inspiration.

We need a really cool schedule component for scheduling events ahead of time.

Make it look good and it should fit in with the rest of the screens.

Start simple and iterate until things are right.

Let me know if you have questions.
